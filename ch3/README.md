# Chapter 3: A FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEWS

System design interviews are always intimidating. It could be as "vague" as designing a well known product. The questions are ambiguous  and seem unreasonably broad.

The system design interview simulates real-life problem-solving where two co-workers collaborate on an ambiguous problem and come up with a solution that meets their goals.

The final design is always less important as compared to the work you put in the design process. This allows you to demonstrate your design skills, defend your design choices and respond to feedback in a constructive manner.

An effective system design interview gives strong signals about a person's ability to collaborate, to work under pressure and to resolve ambiguity constructively. The ability to ask good questions is also a skill, and many interviewers specifically look for that.
